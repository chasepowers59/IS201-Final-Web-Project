        </div>
        <div class="testimony">
            <p>My love for Jesus Christ is the foundation of my life. I have come to know Him as my Savior, Redeemer, and friend through personal study, prayer, and experiences that have confirmed His reality and love for me. His teachings guide my decisions, and His atonement gives me hope when I fall short.</p>
            
            <p>One of my favorite scriptures reminds me of His endless love:</p>
            <div class="scripture">
                "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."

            </div>
            
            <p>Through both joyful and challenging times, I've felt His guidance and comfort. My relationship with Him continues to deepen as I strive to follow His example of love, service, and compassion.</p>

        <h3>Call to Serve</h3>
        <p>Serving a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was a pivotal experience in my spiritual journey. When I received my mission call, I felt a mixture of excitement and nervousness about dedicating two years of my life to sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <div class="timeline-date">Pre-Mission Preparation</div>
                <p>Before my mission, I focused on deepening my understanding of the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon. I attended the temple, sought spiritual guidance, and prepared myself mentally and emotionally for the challenges ahead.</p>
            </div>

                <div class="timeline-date">Missionary Training Center</div>
                <p>My time at the MTC was intense but rewarding. I developed teaching skills, studied the doctrines of the gospel, and learned to better communicate my testimony of Jesus Christ. This foundation prepared me for the field.</p>

        <div class="lesson-learned">
            <h3>The Power of Daily Discipleship</h3>
            <p>My mission taught me the importance of daily scripture study, prayer, and ministering to others. These habits formed on my mission have become essential parts of my daily life, helping me maintain my connection with Christ.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="lesson-learned">
            <h3>Resilience Through Adversity</h3>
            <p>Facing rejection, navigating cultural differences, and overcoming personal limitations taught me resilience. I learned that with Christ's help, I could do difficult things and grow through challenges rather than being defeated by them.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="lesson-learned">
            <h3>The Gift of Empathy</h3>
            <p>Meeting people from all walks of life expanded my capacity to understand and connect with others. I learned to listen without judgment and see each person as a beloved child of God with their own unique journey.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="lesson-learned">
            <h3>The Joy of Service</h3>
            <p>Whether helping someone move, cleaning up after a natural disaster, or simply offering a listening ear, service brought genuine happiness. I discovered that Christ's teachings about losing yourself in service to find yourself are profoundly true.</p>
